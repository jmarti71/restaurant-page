## Description
This is a simple restaurant webpage designed as an assignment for The Odin Project. The goal of this project was to practice working with ES6 modules (bundled with Webpack) to dynamically render a webpage using JavaScript alone. Overall, I felt like this was a great introduction to using ES6 modules and Webpack.
